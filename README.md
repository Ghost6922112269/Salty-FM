# FPS Manager

FPS Manager is modern and extremely customizable module for Tera Toolbox which can help to solve annoynce by some ingame messages and fps drops.

## Overview

- Zoom zoom! (created with modern javascript without slow strings manipulations or memory leaks)
- Detailed documentation
- Readable codebase (FPS Manager developed with strict codebase styling/best practice rules and zero deprecated runtime functions)
- CI/DI (Every update verified for possible issues and manifest file generated automatically, developer notified instantly if issues detected)
- Supports latest Tera Toolbox features (be on the edge of progress :) )
- Client data usage (most of data grabbed from client instead of manual update by developer) 
- Protection from another mods (fps manager trying to catch all data before average mods and apply changes after them so nothing can affect expected result)
- Event driven ideology (setup mod one time and apply your configuration based on ingame events automatically)
- Easy start (readable options names and zero dangerous/critical options available)
- Fully clientside (FPS Manager will never send something to server)
- Class based configuration (just ingame events not enough? Enjoy custom settings combinations automatic switch based on game class)
- Shareable configuration (friend want to use your settings? It is not issue anymore. Just drag and drop them!)
- Dynamic configuration (FPS Manager can detect presets changes at your drive without game restart!)
- Custom modes (don't like predefined settings for configurations or they can't fit your gameplay? just rename everything or create personal configurations)
- Optional commands (commands IS OPTIONAL and can be disabled in settings)
- Interactive messages (Want to know details about mod automation decisions? Just use interactive mode)
- Manual mode (can apply your custom settings in middle of combat - use advanced commands to overwrite automation)
